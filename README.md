Task Descriptoin : -   project is to develop a real-time chat application with full frontend and backend integration using Socket.IO, a JavaScript library built on top of WebSocket. This application will allow 
                       multiple users to connect simultaneously, exchange messages in real-time, and see updates from other users without the need for page refreshes.
                       The backend will be developed using Node.js with the Express framework to serve the frontend files and handle WebSocket connections via Socket.IO. The frontend will be a simple, responsive 
                       HTML/CSS interface with JavaScript for user interaction, message input, and real-time updates.This chat application provides practical experience with event-driven programming, server-client 
                       architecture, and asynchronous communication, which are all vital skills in modern web development
